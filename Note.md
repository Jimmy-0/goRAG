# Building an Intelligent Document QA System with Azure OpenAI, Go, and Streamlit

In this tutorial, we'll build a powerful document question-answering system that combines the strengths of Azure OpenAI's language models, Go's performance, and Streamlit's user-friendly interface. Our system will allow users to upload documents, search through them semantically, and get AI-generated answers based on the document contents.

## System Architecture Overview

Before diving into the implementation, let's understand the key components and flow of our system:

1. **Document Processing Pipeline**:
   - Users upload documents through a Streamlit interface
   - Documents are processed and embedded using Azure OpenAI
   - Embeddings are stored in ChromaDB for efficient similarity search

2. **Search and QA Pipeline**:
   - Users ask questions through the interface
   - The system finds relevant documents using semantic search
   - Azure OpenAI generates comprehensive answers based on the found context

## Prerequisites

- Azure OpenAI subscription with access to embeddings and GPT models
- Go 1.20 or later
- Python 3.8 or later
- Docker (for running ChromaDB)

## Part 1: Setting Up the Backend

### Step 1: Project Structure Setup

First, let's create our project structure. This organization helps maintain clean separation of concerns:

```bash
mkdir -p backend/{services,handlers} frontend
```

**Why this structure?**
- Separating backend and frontend allows independent scaling and deployment
- The services directory contains core business logic
- Handlers manage HTTP request/response lifecycle

### Step 2: Azure OpenAI Integration

The Azure OpenAI service is our AI backbone, handling both embeddings and text generation. Here's what it does:

1. **Document Embeddings**: Converts text into high-dimensional vectors that capture semantic meaning
2. **Answer Generation**: Creates natural language responses based on found documents

Key implementation decisions in `services/azure_openai.go`:
- Use environment variables for configuration flexibility
- Separate embedding and completion models for cost optimization
- Implement robust error handling for API calls

### Step 3: Vector Storage with ChromaDB

ChromaDB serves as our vector database, enabling efficient similarity search. Why ChromaDB?
- Open-source and easy to deploy
- Optimized for similarity search
- Supports metadata filtering

The implementation in `services/chromadb.go` handles:
- Document storage with embeddings
- Efficient nearest neighbor search
- Metadata management for additional filtering

### Step 4: Document Management Service

The document service (`services/document.go`) coordinates between different components:
1. Receives document uploads
2. Gets embeddings from Azure OpenAI
3. Stores documents and embeddings in ChromaDB
4. Manages document lifecycle (CRUD operations)

### Step 5: Search Service Implementation

The search service (`services/search.go`) implements our core QA functionality:
1. Converts user questions into embeddings
2. Finds relevant documents in ChromaDB
3. Constructs context from found documents
4. Generates answers using Azure OpenAI

## Part 2: Building the Frontend

### Step 1: Streamlit Interface Design

Our Streamlit interface provides three main functionalities:

1. **Document Upload**:
   - Text input for document content
   - Metadata input in JSON format
   - Upload status feedback

2. **Search & QA**:
   - Question input field
   - Answer display with source documents
   - Clean, user-friendly layout

3. **Document Management**:
   - List all documents
   - View and delete documents
   - Metadata visualization

### Step 2: API Integration

The frontend communicates with our Go backend through a REST API:
- Clean separation between UI and business logic
- Easy to extend or replace frontend
- Stateless communication

## Part 3: Deployment and Configuration

### Step 1: Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in your backend directory:
```env
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=your_endpoint
AZURE_OPENAI_KEY=your_key
AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT=your_deployment_name
AZURE_OPENAI_EMBEDDING_DEPLOYMENT=your_embedding_deployment_name
```

### Step 2: Running the System

1. Start ChromaDB:
```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 chromadb/chroma
```

2. Run the Go backend:
```bash
cd backend
go run main.go
```

3. Launch the Streamlit frontend:
```bash
cd frontend
streamlit run app.py
```

## System Features and Benefits

1. **Semantic Search**
   - Goes beyond keyword matching
   - Understands context and meaning
   - Finds relevant documents even with different phrasing

2. **AI-Powered Answers**
   - Generates natural language responses
   - Synthesizes information from multiple documents
   - Provides source references for transparency

3. **Scalable Architecture**
   - Separate components can be scaled independently
   - Easy to extend with new features
   - Clean separation of concerns

4. **User-Friendly Interface**
   - Simple document upload process
   - Intuitive search interface
   - Clear presentation of results

## Best Practices and Production Considerations

1. **Security**
   - Implement proper authentication
   - Validate and sanitize inputs
   - Secure API endpoints

2. **Performance**
   - Cache frequently accessed documents
   - Optimize embedding storage
   - Implement rate limiting

3. **Monitoring**
   - Log important operations
   - Track API usage
   - Monitor system health

## Conclusion

This system demonstrates how to combine modern AI capabilities with robust backend services and a user-friendly frontend. The architecture is designed to be both powerful and extensible, allowing for future enhancements such as:

- Support for more document formats
- Advanced filtering and search options
- Multi-user support
- Custom training for specific domains

The combination of Azure OpenAI, Go, and Streamlit provides a solid foundation for building sophisticated document QA systems that can be adapted to various use cases and requirements.

## Next Steps

Possible enhancements to consider:
1. Add support for file uploads (PDF, DOCX)
2. Implement user authentication
3. Add document categorization
4. Enhance answer generation with cited sources
5. Add support for batch document processing
